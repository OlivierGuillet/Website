Hello from Nantes !

My passion is to discover how computer sciences are shaping our future, particulary via Virtual / Augmented Reality and the Internet of Things. Geek at heart since childhood, I love to experiment and learn various things. 
 
I'm currently employed as a senior software engineer and product manager by Emotic. We help our clients with their Digital Transformation, through consulting and with the help of various technologies (web, mobile, digital signage & multi-touch interactions, NFC, IoT, etc...).

Before Emotic I worked as a software engineer for health insurance and employee savings companies. Prior to that, I also was a video game programmer for a few years in Paris, making PC and PlayStation games.
